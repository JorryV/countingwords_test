Feedback I received: Next time add a readme.txt file to explain how to install, use and start the code.
So here is the feedback added in my first repository.

Goal
The goal of this project is to count the words given in a string. It was a test to benchmark where I am standing right now with programming. Not all of it is finished.
There are 3 functions inside the project.

The function: CalculateHighestFrequency, returns the frequency as number of most used word in the sentence.
The function: CalculateFrequencyForWord, returns the frequency as number of the word that has been 'selected' to count.
The function: CalculateMostFrequentNWords n = 3, should return the top N (N = 3) most used words with their frequency. Sadly this function wasn't finished.


1. How to install
Save all files together in the same folder.
Open the file 'Wordcount.html' in any browser (prefered Chrome or Edge).

2. How to use
The 'Wordcount.html' file is self explanatory, there are buttons to click which return the numbers for that function.
In the console (opened in Edge by pressing F12) also outputs the answer of each functions
Within the file: 'javascript-file.js' is a string defined. This string can be changed and will be used to count the words!

I am aware of the seperation of words isn't 100% right, and for now this was the best I could deliver.

Enjoy!
